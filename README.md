If you open index.html locally in a browser you'll see a pure-HTML mockup of a site. What we would like to see is this same mockup but in a react application which utilizes the Asset.json file as seed data. The main point is to see how you would architect the solution but a few high level tasks would be:
* _hydrating the cards in the middle with data in a JSON file_
* _event binding_

Take a few days and see what you can put together.  We're not looking for one particular solution or even a correct/complete solution although that would be great. 

We want to see how you get up to speed on new languages and how quickly you can catch on so we'll time box this to **no more than a week**.
